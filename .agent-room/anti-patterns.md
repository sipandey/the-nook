# Anti-Patterns Log — journal

Negative knowledge: things that have already gone wrong here, so nobody
(human or agent) repeats them. One avoided bug is worth more than one
polished example — keep entries short and concrete.

Append a new entry every time:
- a bug slips through and you find the root cause,
- an approach seemed reasonable but turned out wrong,
- a fix gets reverted because it only patched a symptom.

## Format

```
### YYYY-MM-DD — short title

**What happened:** one or two sentences.
**Root cause:** the actual cause, not the symptom.
**Avoid:** the concrete rule that would have prevented it.
```
